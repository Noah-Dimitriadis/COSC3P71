All the dependencies can be found inside requirements.txt

The only dependency that is in there is easygui which is used to provide a nice file selection window. Everything else should be installed with the python standard libraries.
The other dependencies are:

Cell -> class I made, it is with the source code
queue -> PriorityQueue
copy -> deepcopy
time

To install it run: ```pip install easygui```
**OR**
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Either works, the program will not work without it.

**Please note**
Sometimes when easygui's file window opens it will open at the very back of whatever windows you have open. If the window doesnt show up right away, hit alt+tab and see if its at the back, it will look just like the file explorer but it has a little feather as the icon.

## Running the program
Run main.py in vscode (where I made the project) or however you want :)
